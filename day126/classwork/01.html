<!--A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the event in the future, however the predicinction might go wrong. its situations are:
pending - waiting for the result.
fulfilled - finished successfully.
rejected - finished with an error.

While it’s being prepared - pending.
If the pizza is delivered - fulfilled.
If the order is canceled or ingredients are missing - rejected.-->

<!--Asynchrony is a programming concept that allows code execution to continue while waiting for some operations for example:
you go read a book while the water boils. When the kettle whistles, you know it’s ready.-->
